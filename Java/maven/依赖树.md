    Transitive Dependencies
        "nearest definition" means that the version used will be the closest one to your project in the tree of dependencies.
    Excluded dependencies - If project X depends on project Y, and project Y depends on project Z, the owner of project X can explicitly exclude project Z as a dependency, using the "exclusion" element.
